# Overview

NindoPhx is a web client for Nindo2 written in Elixir using Phoenix Framework. It has a cool dark mode, and supports 80% of Nindo's features.

This is an attempt to port the main social view (home feed, discover, search and sources) to LiveView. If successfull, I will also try to port some other parts of Nindo (mainly posts, external posts, comments and feeds).

## Features

- Posts with images
- Comments
- Encrypted user data
- Modern design
- Construct your own feed
- No AI nonsense
- Nice dark mode
- Every user's post are exported in an RSS feed
- REST API

## TODOs
