# NindoPhx

Nindo is a small-scale self-hosted opensource social media platform. Its key features are security, ease of use and reliabilty. It is designed by Robin Boers and built using Phoenix Framework and Elixir.

Nindo was first built as a small chatting platform for a local community in Maassluis. It's codebase was pretty terrrible and very insecure. This newer version of Nindo is fully rewritten in Elixir and much more stable and secure than the original. The old Nindo archive can be found on my [personal website](https://www.geheimesite.nl/library/projects/package/nindo.php). It is full of cool old stuff.

Some people ask why I called it Nindo. Well, the anwser is is: I liked Ninjas when I built the original version and I still like the name. Did you know it was originally called DGAW when it was in the first alpha stages? I know, a terrible name :)
