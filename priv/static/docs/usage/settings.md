# Account preferences

Every Nindo account has these settings:

- Emailaddress (private but required)
- Display name (optional)
- Description/biography (optional)
- Profile picture (optional with a default avatar)
- Password

They can be changed in the settings panel, which can be accessed via the "Settings" tab in the sidebar.

_Note: currently there is a bug where you first need to reload the page before update preferences are shows. I'm working on it._
