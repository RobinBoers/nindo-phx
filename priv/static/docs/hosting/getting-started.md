# Getting started

Nindo can be self-hosted. That means you can host your own instance of Nindo for your personal use. This is a short guide on how to set that up.

Before you continue, you need to fork or clone [RobinBoers/nindo-phx](https://github.com/RobinBoers/nindo-phx).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobinBoers/nindo-phx
```
